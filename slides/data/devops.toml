# DevOps culture

* **Autonomous teams**
  * *Lightweight decision making* process

* **Focus on the process, not just the product**
  * Promote small, *incremental changes*
  * *Automate* as much as possible
  * Leverage the right *tool* for the job at hand

# Why bother?

1. **Risk management**
    * Reduce the probability of *failure*
    * Detect *defects* before hitting the market
    * Quickly *react* to problems

2. **Resource exploitation**
    * Use *human resources* for human-y work
    * Reduce *time to market*
    * Embrace *innovation*
