<h2 id="1-make-architecture-decisions">(1) Make Architecture Decisions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An architect is expected to define the architecture decisions and design principles used to <em>guide technology decisions</em> within the team, the department, or across the enterprise</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An architect should guide rather than specify technology choices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guiding technology choices through architecture decisions and design principles is difficult</p>
<ul>
<li>The key to making effective architectural decisions is asking whether the architecture decision is helping to guide teams in making the right technical choice or whether the architecture decision makes the technical choice for them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>An architect on occasion might need to make specific technology decisions in order to preserve a particular architectural characteristic such as scalability, performance, or availability</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case it would be still considered an architectural decision, even though it specifies a particular technology</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="2-continually-analyze-the-architecture">(2) Continually Analyze the Architecture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An architect is expected to <em>continually analyze the architecture</em> and current technology environment and then <em>recommend solutions for improvement</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This expectation of an architect refers to architecture vitality, which assesses how viable the architecture that was defined three or more years ago is today, given changes in both business and technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not enough architects focus their energies on continually analyzing existing architectures</p>
<ul>
<li>As a result, most architectures experience elements of structural decay, which occurs when developers make coding or design changes that impact the required architectural characteristics, such as performance, availability, and scalability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>An architect must holistically analyze changes in technology and problem domains to determine the soundness of the architecture</p>
<ul>
<li>Architects must meet this expectation to keep applications relevant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="3-keep-current-with-latest-trends">(3) Keep Current with Latest Trends</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An architect is expected to keep current with the latest technology and industry trends</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developers must keep up to date on the latest technologies they use to remain relevant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An architect has an even more critical requirement to keep current on the latest technical and industry trends</p>
<ul>
<li>The decisions an architect makes tend to be long-lasting and difficult to change</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding and following key trends helps the architect prepare for the future and make the correct decision</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="4-ensure-compliance-with-decisions">(4) Ensure Compliance with Decisions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An architect is expected to ensure compliance with architecture decisions and design principles</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring compliance means that the architect is continually verifying that development teams are following the architecture decisions and design principles defined, documented, and communicated by the architect</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="5-diverse-exposure-and-experience">(5) Diverse Exposure and Experience</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An architect is expected to have exposure to multiple and diverse technologies, frameworks, platforms, and environments</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This expectation does not mean an architect must be an expert in every framework, platform, and language, but rather that an architect must at least be familiar with a variety of technologies</p>
<ul>
<li>Most environments these days are heterogeneous, and at a minimum an architect should know how to interface with multiple systems and services, irrespective of the language, platform, and technology those systems or services are written in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best ways of mastering this expectation is for the architect to stretch their comfort zone.</p>
<ul>
<li>An effective software architect should be aggressive in seeking out opportunities to gain experience in multiple languages, platforms, and technologies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="6-have-business-domain-knowledge">(6) Have Business Domain Knowledge</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An architect is expected to have a certain level of business domain expertise</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Effective software architects understand not only technology but also the business domain of a problem space
<ul>
<li>Without business domain knowledge, it is difficult to understand the business problem, goals, and requirements, making it difficult to design an effective architecture to meet the requirements of the business</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="7-possess-interpersonal-skills">(7) Possess Interpersonal Skills</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An architect is expected to possess exceptional interpersonal skills, including teamwork, facilitation, and leadership</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having exceptional leadership and interpersonal skills is a difficult expectation for most developers and architects</p>
<ul>
<li>As technologists, developers and architects like to solve technical problems, not people problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>An architect is not only expected to provide technical guidance to the team, but is also expected to lead the development teams</p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership skills are at least half of what it takes to become an effective software architect, regardless of the role or title the architect has</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="8-understand-and-navigate-politics">(8) Understand and Navigate Politics</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An architect is expected to understand the political climate of the enterprise and be able to navigate the politics</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Almost every decision an architect makes will be challenged</p>
<ul>
<li>Architectural decisions will be challenged by product owners, project managers, and business stakeholders due to increased costs or increased effort (time) involved</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architectural decisions will also be challenged by developers who feel their approach is better</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The architect must navigate the politics of the company and apply basic negotiation skills to get most decisions approved</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="laws-of-software-architecture">&ldquo;Laws of Software Architecture&rdquo;</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>First Law of Software Architecture</em><br>
<strong>Everything in software architecture is a trade-off</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nothing exists on a nice, clean spectrum for software architects; every decision must take into account many opposing factors</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Corollary 1</em><br>
<strong>If an architect thinks they have discovered something that isn&rsquo;t a trade-off, more likely they just haven&rsquo;t identified the trade-off yet</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Second Law of Software Architecture</em><br>
<strong>&ldquo;Why&rdquo; is more important than &ldquo;how&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An architect can look at an existing system they have no knowledge of and ascertain how the structure of the architecture works

<p>As an architect, <em>breadth is more important than depth</em></p>

<h2 id="analyzing-trade-offs">Analyzing Trade-Offs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thinking like an architect is all about seeing trade-offs in every solution, technical or otherwise

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Architecture is the stuff you can’t Google!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything in architecture is a trade-off, which is why the famous answer to every architecture question in the universe is &ldquo;<strong>it depends</strong>&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>While many people get increasingly annoyed at this answer, it is unfortunately true&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>An Example<br>
You cannot Google the answer to whether REST or messaging would be better, or whether microservices is the right architecture style, because it does depend. It depends on the deployment environment, business drivers, company culture, budgets, timeframes, developer skill set, and dozens of other factors. Everyone’s environment, situation, and problem is different, hence why architecture is so hard</p>

<li>and translating those requirements into architecture characteristics</li>
<li>such as scalability, performance, availability, &hellip;</li>

<h3 id="avoiding-the-bottleneck-trap">Avoiding the bottleneck trap</h3>
<ul>
<li>The bottleneck trap occurs when the architect has taken ownership of code within the critical path of a project and becomes a bottleneck to the team
<ul>
<li>This happens because the architect is not a full-time developer and therefore must balance between playing the developer role and the architect role</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>POCs helps validate an architecture decision by taking the implementation details into account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an architect is stuck trying to make a decision between two caching solutions, one effective way to help make this decision is to develop a working example in each caching product and compare the results</p>
<ul>
<li>This allows the architect to see first-hand the implementation details and the amount of effort required to develop the full solution</li>
<li>It also allows the architect to better compare architectural characteristics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When doing proof-of-concept work is that, whenever possible, the architect should write the best production-quality code they can</p>
<ol>
<li>POCs code goes into the source code repository and becomes the reference architecture or guiding example for others to follow</li>
<li>By writing production-quality proof-of-concept code, the architect gets practice writing quality, well-structured code rather than continually developing bad coding practices</li>

<p>In Figure fields appear as single letters and methods appear as blocks. In Class <code>X</code>, the LCOM score is low, indicating good structural cohesion. Class <code>Y</code>, however, lacks cohesion; each of the field/method pairs in Class <code>Y</code> could appear in its own class without affecting behavior. Class <code>Z</code> shows mixed cohesion, where developers could refactor the last field/method combination into its own class.</p>

<h2 id="lack-of-cohesion-in-methods-lcom-1">Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The LCOM metric is useful to architects who are analyzing code bases in order to move from one architectural style to another</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the LCOM metric can help architects find classes that are incidentally coupled and should never have been a single class to begin with</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g., shared utility classes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many software metrics have serious deficiencies, and LCOM is not immune</p>
<ul>
<li>All this metric can find is structural lack of cohesion</li>
<li>It has no way to determine logically if particular pieces fit together</li>
<li>This reflects back on our 2nd Law of Software Architecture: prefer why over how!</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Afferent</em> and <em>Efferent</em> coupling</p>
<ul>
<li>Afferent coupling measures the number of incoming connections to a code artifact (component, class, function, and so on)</li>
<li>Efferent coupling measures the outgoing connections to other code artifacts</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coupling-metrics-abstractness">Coupling Metrics: Abstractness</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Abstractness</em> is the ratio of abstract artifacts (abstract classes, interfaces, and so on) to concrete artifacts (implementation)

<li>It represents a measure of abstractness versus implementation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>$$A=\frac{\sum m^a}{\sum m^c}$$</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the equation, $m^a$ represents abstract elements (interfaces or abstract classes) with the module, and $m^c$ represents concrete elements (nonabstract classes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architects calculate abstractness by calculating the ratio of the sum of abstract artifacts to the sum of the concrete ones</p>

<h2 id="coupling-metrics-instability">Coupling Metrics: Instability</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Instability</em> is defined as the ratio of efferent coupling to the sum of both efferent and afferent coupling</li>
</ul>
<p>$$I=\frac{\sum c^e}{\sum c^e + c^a}$$</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the equation, $c^e$ represents efferent (or outgoing) coupling, and $c^a$ represents afferent (or incoming) coupling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The instability metric determines the volatility of a code base</p>
<ul>
<li>A code base that exhibits high degrees of instability breaks more easily when changed because of high coupling</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Example - If a class calls to many other classes to delegate work ($C^e \gg C^a$), the calling class shows high susceptibility to breakage if one or more of the called methods change</p>

<p>For example, consider the following two scenarios</p>

<p>Third-party payment processor - If an integration point handles payment details, then the architecture shouldn’t require special structural considerations. The design should incorporate standard security hygiene, such as encryption and hashing, but doesn’t require special structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In-application payment processing - If the application under design must handle payment processing, the architect may design a specific module, component, or service for that purpose to isolate the critical security concerns structurally. Now, the architecture characteristic has an impact on both architecture and design.</p>

<p>Two ways to overcome this anti-pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wait until the last responsible moment to make an important architecture decision</p>

<li>the <em>likelihood of that risk occurring</em></li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>Each dimensions has a low (1), medium (2), and high (3) rating</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Suppose there is a concern about availability with regard to a primary central database used in the application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, consider the impact dimension</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the overall impact if the database goes down or becomes unavailable?</li>
<li>Here, an architect might deem that high risk, making that risk either a 3 (medium), 6 (high), or 9 (high)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, after applying the second dimension (likelihood of risk occurring):</p>
<ul>
<li>the architect realizes that the database is on highly available servers in a clustered configuration</li>
<li>so the likelihood is low that the database would become unavailable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the intersection between the high impact and low likelihood gives an overall risk rating of 3 (medium risk)</p>
