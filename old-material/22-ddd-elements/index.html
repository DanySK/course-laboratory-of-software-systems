<!--Complex problem domains will contain a wealth of information, some of which will not be applicable to solving the problem at hand and will only act to distract from the real focus of your modeling efforts.-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Knowledge crunching is the art of <strong>distilling relevant information from the problem domain to build a useful model that can fulfill the needs of business use cases</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The key to bridging any knowledge gaps for the technical team when designing a solution for a problem domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order for a team to produce a  useful model they need to have a deep insight of the problem domain to ensure important concepts are not overlooked or misunderstood.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This can only be done through working in collaboration with domain experts (brainstorming together)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without effective knowledge crunching, a technical solution will be produced without any real domain insight and correlation with it</p>
</li>
</ul>

<!--The process of knowledge crunching, as shown in Figure 2-1, starts with the behaviors of a system. The team go through the scenarios of the application with the business stakeholders and experts. This process is the catalyst to the conversation, deep insight, and a shared understanding of the domain for all participants. It is therefore vital that stakeholders and subject matter experts are actively involved and engaged.-->

<h2 id="ubiquitous-language">Ubiquitous Language</h2>
<ul>
<li>An output of knowledge crunching and an artifact of the shared understanding is a common <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> (UL)
<ul>
<li>This language must be made explicit and be used when describing the domain model and problem domain</li>
<li>The language <em>should also be used in the code implementation of the model</em> (with the same terms and concepts used as class names, properties, and method names)</li>
<li>It is the language that enables both the business and development teams to have meaningful communication about the software</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--* UL is used to bind the code representation of the model to the conceptual model communicated in language and diagrams.-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>The UL will contain terminology from the business as well as new concepts and terms discovered when modeling the use case of the problem domain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shared understanding obtained with a well defined UL prevents the need to constantly translate from a technical model to a business model</p>

<p>A use case lists the steps required to achieve a goal, including the interactions between users and systems.</p>

<p>Be careful to listen for domain terminology, because this forms the start of your shared language for describing and communicating the problem domain.</p>

<p>It’s also useful to read back the use case to the domain expert in your own understanding, so they can validate that you do understand the use case as they do.</p>

<ul>
<li>It partitions the system functionality into transactions meaningful to actors (users of a system).</li>
<li>The pieces of interactive functionality are called use cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A use case describes an interaction with actors as a sequence of messages between the system and one or more actors.</p>

<h2 id="actors">Actors</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An actor is an idealization of an external person, process, or thing interacting with a system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An actor characterizes the interactions that outside users may have with the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>At run time, one physical user may be bound to multiple actors within the system.</li>
<li>Different users may be bound to the same actor and therefore represent multiple instances of the same actor definition.</li>
<li>Each actor participates in one or more use cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The internal implementation of an actor is not relevant in the use case</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors may be defined in generalization hierarchies, in which an abstract actor description is shared and augmented by one or more specific actor descriptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A use case is a coherent unit of externally visible functionality provided by a system unit and expressed by sequences of messages exchanged by the system unit and one or more actors of the system unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of a use case is to define a
piece of coherent behavior without revealing the internal structure of the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the model, the execution of each use case is independent of the others, although implementation of the use cases may create implicit dependencies among them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each use case represents an orthogonal piece of functionality whose execution can be mixed with the execution of other use
cases.</p>

<h2 id="class-responsibility-collaboration-crc-cards">Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) Cards</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because DDD is built around the core idea of a shared language, it is important to use knowledge-gathering techniques that focus on creating a concise and powerful language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CRC (Class Responsibility Collaboration) cards are divided into three areas and contain the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>A class <strong>name</strong>, which represents a concept in the domain</li>
<li>The <strong>responsibilities</strong> of the class</li>
<li>Classes that are <strong>associated</strong> and are required to fulfill its purpose</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>CRC cards focus the team and the business experts on thinking about the language of the concepts in the problem domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Martin Fowler has described CRC cards as a viable alternative to UML sequence diagram to design the dynamics of object interaction and collaboration</p>

<h2 id="rapid-prototyping">Rapid Prototyping</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Favour rapid prototyping during knowledge‐crunching sessions!</p>
<ul>
<li>Business users like nothing more than screen mock‐ups, because they reveal so much more about the intent they have behind a product</li>
<li>Users understand UI; they can interact with it and act out work flows clearly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another form of rapid prototyping is to capture requirements in code</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting to code will help focus analysis sessions</li>
<li>Starting to implement abstract ideas from knowledge crunching will enable you to validate and prove your model</li>
<li>It also helps to avoid only abstract thinking, which can lead to analysis paralysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coding quickly helps create your powerful questions and helps find missing use cases</p>
<ul>
<li>NOTE (1): Coding at this level is part of the analysis process!</li>
<li>NOTE (2): Only create a code model of what is relevant and within the specific context to solve a given problem; you can’t effectively model the entire domain.</li>

<p><strong>Not all parts of a problem are equal!</strong></p>

<li>Some parts need more attention and investment than others to make the application a success</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>During knowledge crunching with domain experts, it’s important to reduce the noise of what’s unimportant to enable you to focus on what is important</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain-Driven Design is all about reducing complexity!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A single monolithic model would increase the complexity</li>

<h2 id="domain-and-subdomains">Domain and Subdomains</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Large problem domains can be partitioned into <em>subdomains</em> to manage complexity and to separate the important parts from the rest of the system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding the subdomains of your system enables you to break down the problem space</p>

<li>
<p>Subdomains are abstract concepts</p>

<li>
<p><strong>By distilling the problem domain you reduce complexity by dividing and conquering the problem</strong></p>

<p>To know where to invest the most effort and quality, it’s crucial to understand where the core domains are because these are key to making software successful</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure the <strong>linguistic consistency</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using a term in code that the domain expert doesn’t say, you need to check it with her
<ul>
<li>It could be that you have found a concept that was required, so it needs to be added to the UL and understood by the domain expert</li>
<li>Alternatively, maybe you misunderstood something that the domain expert said; therefore, you should rectify the code with the correct term</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a <strong>glossary of domain terms</strong> with the domain expert to avoid confusion</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that you use one word for a specific concept</li>
<li>Don’t use terms that have a specific meaning in software development (such as design pattern names&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the language to drive the design of your code</p>
<ul>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t let the truth get in the way of a good model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A domain model is not a model of real-life; it is a system of abstractions on reality, an interpretation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model only what is relevant</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to include everything into the model</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain models are temporarily useful</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A domain model needs to be constantly refined to continually be useful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be explicit with terminology and limit your abstractions</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implement the model in code early and often</strong></p>

<h2 id="domain-model-pattern---details">Domain Model Pattern - Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a pure object‐oriented approach that involves creating an abstract model of the real business domain and is useful when dealing with complex logic and workflow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is persistence ignorant and relies on mapper classes and other abstraction patterns to persist and retrieve business entities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid trying to apply the domain model pattern for everything</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a good candidate when you have to model complex logic or part of the problem domain that requires clarity because it’s important, or will change often due to continued investment</li>

<li>The object is responsible for all persistence needs along with business logic behavior</li>

<p>At a first glance, it might not be a good fit for DDD</p>

<p><strong>Bounded Context</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Defines the applicability of the model</li>

<h2 id="the-challenges-of-a-single-model">The Challenges of a Single Model</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the core of Domain‐Driven Design there is the need to create explicit, evolvable models in code that align with the shared conceptual models</p>
<ul>
<li>As new domain insights are gained, they can be incorporated into the model efficiently</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a single model is used for an entire system, concepts from one area of the model can be confused with similar-sounding concepts from another
area of the system (and even become coupled to them)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DDD advocates that you break up a large complex system into multiple code models</p>
