<li>
<p><em>CQRS separates the domain model into two models</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>read model</em> and a <em>write model</em> (sometimes called a transactional model)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason for the separation is to <em>enable a model to serve the needs of a single context without compromise</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The two contexts in question are reporting on the state of the domain (read) and performing business tasks (write)</li>
<li>&hellip;. enabling each model to be optimized to serve each context more effectively</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Motivation: reducing bounded contexts complexity towards a better maintainability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CQRS is not a top‐level architecture</p>
<ul>
<li>it is <em>a pattern for handling complexity</em> that can be applied against bounded contexts needing to support a presentation model that is not aligned to the structure of the transactional model</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In a typical layered architecture of a bounded context, the domain model is created to enforce the invariants of the domain when handling transactional operations</p>
<ul>
<li>The model is composed of small aggregate groupings of domain objects built for consistency and that express the rules and logic of the domain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reporting needs of an application may not be aligned with the structure of the aggregates</p>
<ul>
<li>application services needing to load many different aggregates to construct view models (containing a subset of the retrieved data)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This view generation can quickly become complex and difficult to maintain and in the very worst scenarios can slow down the system</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section><section>
<h2 id="challenges-and-issues">Challenges and Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To support view generation, domain models need to expose internal state and need to be adorned with presentation properties that have little to do with the invariants of the domain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repositories often contain many extra methods on the contract to support presentation needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the read side of an application is typically used more frequently than the write side, users often seek improvements in report generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To try to simplify as well as improve performance of the query side, the model is compromised</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregates are merged, and lazy loading is used to prevent pulling data that is not required for transactional business task processing needs, but that is required for presentational purposes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This leads to a single model that is full of compromises and is sub-standard for both reading and writing.</p>

<h2 id="the-misconceptions-of-cqrs-13">THE MISCONCEPTIONS OF CQRS (1/3)</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>CQRS Is Hard</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At a fundamental level, it’s an implementation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) applied at the domain model layer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s useful for solving the complexity that arises when a presentational model is not in alignment with a transactional model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CQRS does not prescribe frameworks, multiple databases, or design patterns</p>
<ul>
<li>It only states that the two contexts should be handled separately for better effectiveness</li>
<li>It’s a conceptual mind shift rather than a collection of complex patterns and principles that you need to adopt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</section><section>
<h2 id="the-misconceptions-of-cqrs-23">THE MISCONCEPTIONS OF CQRS (2/3)</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>CQRS Is Eventually Consistent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eventual consistency is the practice of having a read model updated out of process and asynchronously to the update of the transactional model</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not a prerequisite of CQRS, but it is often used to enable the read side of a model to scale</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually consistent read models add an extra layer of complexity to an application</p>
<ul>
<li>CQRS does not require you to be eventually consistent</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your Models Need to Be Event Sourced</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using event sourcing is an effective method to build both the read and the write models;
<ul>
<li>there is no prerequisite to using event sourcing or in fact domain events with CQRS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commands Should Be Asynchronous</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CQRS does not insist on commands being sent in a fire‐and‐forget fashion
<ul>
<li>For highly collaborative domains, in which multiple users are making changes to the same data, asynchronous commands make sense</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</section><section>
<h2 id="the-misconceptions-of-cqrs-33">THE MISCONCEPTIONS OF CQRS (3/3)</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>CQRS Only Works with Messaging Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are looking to apply an eventually consistent read store or process commands asynchronously, then using a messaging framework is probably a good idea</li>
<li>However, if you are not, then adding a messaging system to your application is just needless complexity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You Need to Use Domain Events with CQRS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using events to build a materialized read model is an effective method to keep your read and write models separate</li>
<li>However, it is not critical, and you can use other methods of creating a materialized read store (e.g., via the memento pattern)</li>

<h2 id="patterns-to-enable-an-application-to-scale">PATTERNS TO ENABLE an APPLICATION TO SCALE</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CQRS enables applications to perform well under heavy load.</p>
<ul>
<li>Separating the read and write sides enables each to be scaled independently to meet the particular demands of the application</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read and write data can also be separated into stores that are best suited to their needs</p>
<ul>
<li>A write store that deals solely with aggregates can utilize a document database or a key-value store</li>
<li>A read model can utilize a relational database or a caching store</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To scale either side you need to understand the trade‐offs involved</p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling out a system isn’t simply a technical decision</li>
<li>It is vital that the business understands that changes to the architecture of a system result in changes to the user experience, and such changes need to be handled carefully and be acceptable to the business</li>

<p>In a typical business use case there are often multiple actions that need to succeed or fail together inside a transaction</p>

<p>Not all interactions with the domain will be successful</p>

<p>These are cases in which domain validation fails (even though application‐level validation was successful)</p>

<h2 id="domain-logic">Domain Logic</h2>
<h2 id="from-an-application-services-perspective">(from an Application Service’s Perspective)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A challenging activity for many DDD practitioners is drawing the line between application logic and domain logic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrastructural concerns are normally easy to identify</p>
<ul>
<li>&hellip; but the coordination logic that pieces together full use cases can sometimes appear to contradict the “No business rules in application services” principle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the logic in the application service is actually a business rule that may be best encapsulated inside a domain service</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="application-services-patterns">Application Services Patterns</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A variety of design patterns can be used inside application services, based on your preferences and based on context&hellip;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Command processor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using the command processor pattern, you can avoid developing large application services with many concerns</li>
<li>Instead, you have a command and a processor for each use case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publish/Subscribe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A pattern for looser coupling is publish/subscribe, whereby application services subscribe to events in the domain</li>
<li>You may want to consider this pattern when your domain logic is inherently event-based, especially when you pass commands into the domain but do not receive a return value</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
