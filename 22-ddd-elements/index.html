<!--Complex problem domains will contain a wealth of information, some of which will not be applicable to solving the problem at hand and will only act to distract from the real focus of your modelling efforts.-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Knowledge crunching is the art of <strong>distilling relevant information from the problem domain to build a useful model that can fulfill the needs of business use cases</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The key to bridging any knowledge gaps for the technical team when designing a solution for a problem domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order for a team to produce a  useful model they need to have a deep insight of the problem domain to ensure important concepts are not overlooked or misunderstood.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can only be done through working in collaboration with domain experts (brainstorming together).</li>
</ul>
  <!--* Without this there is a danger that a technical solution will be produced that is void of any real domain insight and something that cannot be understood by the business or by other developers during software maintenance or subsequent enhancements.-->
</li>
<li>
<p>The main goal: <strong>discover and agree on a shared understanding of the problem domain to produce a model that can fulfill business use cases</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<!--The process of knowledge crunching, as shown in Figure 2-1, starts with the behaviors of a system. The team go through the scenarios of the application with the business stakeholders and experts. This process is the catalyst to conversation, deep insight, and a shared understanding of the domain for all participants. It is therefore vital that stakeholders and subject matter experts are actively involved and engaged.-->
</section><section>
<h2 id="shared-understanding-through-a-shared-language">Shared Understanding through a Shared Language</h2>
<ul>
<li>An output of knowledge crunching and an artifact of the shared understanding is a common <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> (UL).
<ul>
<li>This language must be made explicit and be used when describing the domain model and problem domain.</li>
<li>The language should also be used in the code implementation of the model (with the same terms and concepts used as class names, properties, and method names).</li>
<li>It is the language that enables both the business and development teams to have meaningful communication about the software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--* UL is used to bind the code representation of the model to the conceptual model communicated in language and diagrams.-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>The UL will contain terminology from the business as well as new concepts and terms discovered when modeling the use case of the problem domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shared understanding obtained with a well defined UL prevents the need to constantly translate from a technical model to a business model.</p>

<p>Model‐driven design and the evolution of a domain model is an ongoing process.</p>

<li>
<p>Many models must be rejected in order to ensure you have a useful model for the current use cases of a system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaboration among development team, business stakeholders, and subject matter experts should not be constrained to the start of a project</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge crunching should be an ongoing concern with the business engaged throughout the <em>lifetime</em> of the application build.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Focus on the most interesting conversations</em>
<ul>

<li>
<p><em>Start from the Use Cases</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A use case lists the steps required to achieve a goal, including the interactions between users and systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful to listen for domain terminology, because this forms the start of your shared language for describing and communicating the problem domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s also useful to read back the use case to the domain expert in your own understanding, so they can validate that you do understand the use case as they do.</p>

<ul>
<li>Useful diagrams: UML Use Case, UML Activity, CRC Cards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping your diagrams at a consistent level of detail will prevent you from showing too much detail or too little detail, meaning everyone can understand what you are trying to convey. It’s often better to create multiple diagrams each at a different level of detail.</p>

<ul>

<p>The use case diagram in UML captures the behavior of a system as it appears to an outside user.</p>
<ul>
<li>It partitions the system functionality into transactions meaningful to actors (users of a system).</li>
<li>The pieces of interactive functionality are called use cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A use case describes an interaction with actors as a sequence of messages between the system and one or more actors.</p>

<h2 id="actors">Actors</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An actor is an idealization of an external person, process, or thing interacting with a system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An actor characterizes the interactions that outside users may have with the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>At run time, one physical user may be bound to multiple actors within the system.</li>
<li>Different users may be bound to the same actor and therefore represent multiple instances of the same actor definition.</li>
<li>Each actor participates in one or more use cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The internal implementation of an actor is not relevant in the use case</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors may be defined in generalization hierarchies, in which an abstract actor description is shared and augmented by one or more specific actor descriptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A use case is a coherent unit of externally visible functionality provided by a system unit and expressed by sequences of messages exchanged by the system unit and one or more actors of the system unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of a use case is to define a
piece of coherent behavior without revealing the internal structure of the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the model, the execution of each use case is independent of the others, although an implementation of the use cases may create implicit dependencies among them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each use case represents an orthogonal piece of functionality whose execution can be mixed with the execution of other use
cases.</p>

<h2 id="class-responsibility-collaboration-crc-cards">Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) Cards</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because DDD is built around the core idea of a shared language, it is important to use knowledge-gathering techniques that focus on creating a concise and powerful language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CRC (Class Responsibility Collaboration) cards are divided into three areas and contain the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>A class <strong>name</strong>, which represents a concept in the domain</li>
<li>The <strong>responsibilities</strong> of the class</li>
<li>Classes that are <strong>associated</strong> and are required to fulfill its purpose</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>CRC cards focus the team and the business experts on thinking about the language of the concepts in the problem domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Martin Fowler has described CRC cards as a viable alternative to UML sequence diagram to design the dynamics of object interaction and collaboration</p>

<h2 id="rapid-prototyping">Rapid Prototyping</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Favour rapid prototyping during knowledge‐crunching sessions!</p>
<ul>
<li>Business users like nothing more than screen mock‐ups, because they reveal so much more about the intent they have behind a product</li>
<li>Users understand UI; they can interact with it and act out work flows clearly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another form of rapid prototyping is to capture requirements in code</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting to code will help focus analysis sessions</li>
<li>Starting to implement abstract ideas from knowledge crunching will enable you to validate and prove your model</li>
<li>It also helps to avoid only abstract thinking, which can lead to analysis paralysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coding quickly helps create your powerful questions and helps find missing use cases</p>
<ul>
<li>NOTE (1): Coding at this level is part of the analysis process!</li>
<li>NOTE (2): Only create a code model of what is relevant and within the specific context to solve a given problem; you can’t effectively model the entire domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impact-mapping">Impact Mapping</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Impact mapping allows to go beyond traditional requirements documents, working on what impacts the business is trying to make</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you understand the impact the business is trying to make, you can play a more effective role in helping them to achieve it</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly for DDD, you will be able to ask better questions during knowledge-crunching sessions since you know what the business wants to achieve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impact mapping is a very informal technique</p>
<ul>
<li>You simply create mind‐map-like diagrams that accentuate key business information</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Modeling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At the same time of running through a scenario, the team starts to examine the current model and assesses its usefulness for solving the scenario expressed by the domain expert</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain-Driven Design is all about reducing complexity!</strong></p>
<ul>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure the <strong>linguistic consistency</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using a term in code that the domain expert doesn’t say, you need to check it with her
<ul>
<li>It could be that you have found a concept that was required, so it needs to be added to the UL and understood by the domain expert</li>
<li>Alternatively, maybe you misunderstood something that the domain expert said; therefore, you should rectify the code with the correct term</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a <strong>glossary of domain terms</strong> with the domain expert to avoid confusion</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that you use one word for a specific concept</li>
<li>Don’t use terms that have a specific meaning in software development (such as design pattern names&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the language to drive the design of your code</p>
